      "Bot: Neil Armstrong was an American astronaut, aerospace engineer, and naval aviator, best known for being the first person to walk on the Moon. He was born on August 5, 1930, in Wapakoneta, Ohio, and he joined NASA in 1962. Armstrong gained fame as the commander of the Apollo 11 mission, which successfully landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. As he stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously declared, \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n",

      "Before his historic Moon landing, Armstrong served as a naval aviator during the Korean War and worked as a test pilot. After retiring from NASA, he taught aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati and remained active in various aerospace-related endeavors. Armstrong passed away on August 25, 2012, but he is remembered as a pioneering figure in space exploration and a symbol of human achievement.\n",
